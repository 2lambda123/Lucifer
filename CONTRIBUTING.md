# CONTRIBUTING

## Modules
If you are contributing modules please open pull requests on the module-dev branch, which will later be bulk pulled into master on my time.  
If your modules fail any codefactor/codehealth checks you wont be pulled onto the module-dev branch so please comply with the pep8 standards.
Remember to add a good description to your module and be sure to follow how other modules have been structured for highest chance of beinng merged.  

## Framework
If you are contributing to the framework (outside the module folder) then you need to pull your changes to the dev branch and will bulk pull into master on my time.  
Remeber to comply with the pep8 standards and write full descriptions in your pull request in what you have changes/fixed/added
